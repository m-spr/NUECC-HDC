# **NUECC-HDC**  
**Non-Uniform Error Correction for Hyperdimensional Computing Edge Accelerators**  

## About NUECC-HDC  

Brain-inspired **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)** has gained traction as an efficient and lightweight machine learning paradigm. With advantages like **one-shot learning** and **resource efficiency**, HDC is well-suited for **edge devices** with limited computational resources.  

While HDC inherently exhibits **fault tolerance**, **soft errors in associative memory** can degrade system performanceâ€”especially in **safety-critical applications** where reliability is paramount. Traditional **Error-Correcting Codes (ECC)** are commonly employed to mitigate such faults, but their **high storage overhead** poses challenges for edge deployments.  

### **Our Contribution**  
We propose a **non-uniform fault correction framework** that enhances **HDC robustness** while preserving **hardware efficiency**.  

-  **Hamming weight-based fault sensitivity analysis** enables efficient classification of associative memory regions, avoiding time-intensive fault injection campaigns.  
-  **Region-wise protection strategy** selectively applies ECC to memory sections based on fault sensitivity, **minimizing overhead while ensuring resilience**.  
-  **Optimized for FPGA implementation**, demonstrating practical feasibility with minimal resource consumption.

## **System Overview**  

The diagram below illustrates our proposed **non-uniform ECC mechanism** for HDC accelerators. This framework:  
 Identifies **sensitive** and **less sensitive** regions (**SR** & **LSR**).  
 Allocates **ECC resources selectively** to balance error correction and storage efficiency.  
 Enables **runtime fault detection and correction** with minimal hardware overhead.

## **Hardware Overview**  

The following figure presents the **non-uniform ECC architecture** for **Class Hypervector (CHV)** within the HDC accelerator.  
- **Sensitive Regions (SR)** are highlighted in **orange**, requiring stricter ECC.  
- **Less Sensitive Regions (LSR)** are shown in **green**, optimized for reduced overhead.
